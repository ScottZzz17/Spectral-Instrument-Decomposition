# Spectral-Instrument-Decomposition
An AI-powered project that uses deep learning and music signal processing to deconstruct songs. It segments audio into beats, analyzes spectral features to gauge instrument density and note details, and exports a DAW-compatible MIDI file for visualizing and reconstructing the songâ€™s structure.
